```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, comment=NA, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8, fig.align='center', eval=TRUE)
```

```

In this example, 2000 replicates are used to get an initial sense of operating characteristics. SeqSGPV is more time intensive for bernoulli outcomes with a sample size as below. It is recommended to start with a small number of replicates, even under 1000, to get an initial sense of operating characteristics and then increase for more precision in estimated operating characteristics.

```{r, cache=FALSE, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
library(SeqSGPV)
nreps <- 2000
```

## Context

An investigator wants to compare the odds ratio between two groups in
which the underlying success probability is anticipated to be 0.35. An
increase in the odds by a factor 1.1 or less (i.e., having a probability
of up to 0.37) is considered practically equivalent or worse than 0.35.
And an increase in the odds by a factor of 1.5 (a probability of 0.45)
is considered scientifically meaningful.

Without incorporating scientific relevance, a traditional hypothesis for
the odds ratio, $\theta$ could be:

H0: $\theta$ $\le$ 1\
H1: $\theta$ \> 1

The PRISM is defined by ROE$_{(1.10, 1.50)}$.

Power calculation for a single-look study

```{r, cache=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
epiR::epi.sscc(OR = 1.5, p1 = NA, p0 = 0.35, n = NA, power = 0.80, r = 1,
               sided.test = 1, conf.level = 0.95, method = "unmatched", fleiss = FALSE)
```

Based on this sample size calculation, the investigator can afford 650
participants and has potential to enroll up to 800 participants.
Outcomes are assessed within two-weeks, which is short enough to allow
all outcomes to be observed before evaluating stopping rules. The
accrual plan is to enroll 50 participants a month. The study team plans
to evaluate outcomes after every 50 observations after observing the
first 150 outcomes.

```{r, cache=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
system.time(PRISM <-  SeqSGPV(nreps            = nreps,
                              dataGeneration   = rbinom, dataGenArgs = list(n=650, size = 1, prob = 0.35),
                              effectGeneration = 1, effectGenArgs=NULL,  effectScale  = "oddsratio",
                              allocation       = c(1,1),
                              effectPN         = 1,
                              null             = "less",
                              PRISM            = list(deltaL2 = NA,   deltaL1 = NA, 
                                                      deltaG1 = 1.1, deltaG2 = 1.5),
                              modelFit         = lrCI,
                              modelFitArgs     = list(miLevel=.95),
                              wait             = 150,
                              steps            = 50,
                              affirm           = c(0,50),
                              lag              = 0,
                              N                = c(650,800,1000),
                              printProgress    = FALSE))



# Note: This step is typically done after evaluating operating characteristics
# under the point null. It will be shown again later.
# This step is done here for the sake of saving an Rmd cache with
# minimal retained data (after removing the simulated date).

# Shift effects
# On the log-odds scale, shift from -0.1 to 0.7 and exponentiate back to odds ratio scale
se <- round(exp(seq(-0.1, .7, by = .1)),2)
system.time(PRISMse <- fixedDesignEffects(PRISM, shift = se))

# This next step is not required but is done for reducing the size of the Rmd cache.
PRISM$mcmcMonitoring <- NULL
```

```{r, cache=FALSE, eval=TRUE}

```

Under this design and an odds-ratio effect of 1 (i.e. zero effect), the
probability of concluding not ROPE is 0.03 and the probability of
concluding not ROME is 0.85. By the 2000th observation there is a 0.12
probability of not ending not being PRISM conclusive.

We may suppose that the success rate in the control group is 0.27
(rather than 0.35). Under this assumption, we can evaluate how this
would effect the study's operating characteristics.

```{r, cache=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
system.time(PRISMb <-  SeqSGPV(nreps            = nreps,
                               dataGeneration   = rbinom, dataGenArgs = list(n=650, size = 1, prob = 0.27),
                               effectGeneration = 1, effectGenArgs=NULL,  effectScale  = "oddsratio",
                               allocation       = c(1,1),
                               effectPN         = 1,
                               null             = "less",
                               PRISM            = list(deltaL2 = NA,   deltaL1 = NA, 
                                                       deltaG1 = 1.1, deltaG2 = 1.5),
                               modelFit         = lrCI,
                               modelFitArgs     = list(miLevel=.95),
                               wait             = 150,
                               steps            = 50,
                               affirm           = c(0,50),
                               lag              = 0,
                               N                = c(650,800,1000),
                               printProgress    = FALSE,
                               outData          = FALSE))
```

```{r, cache=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
summary(PRISMb, N=800, affirm = 0)
```

And we can see what would be the impact if the rate in the control group
were 0.40.

```{r, cache=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
system.time(PRISMc <-  SeqSGPV(nreps            = nreps,
                               dataGeneration   = rbinom, dataGenArgs = list(n=650, size = 1, prob = 0.40),
                               effectGeneration = 1, effectGenArgs=NULL,  effectScale  = "oddsratio",
                               allocation       = c(1,1),
                               effectPN         = 1,
                               null             = "less",
                               PRISM            = list(deltaL2 = NA,   deltaL1 = NA, 
                                                       deltaG1 = 1.1, deltaG2 = 1.5),
                               modelFit         = lrCI,
                               modelFitArgs     = list(miLevel=.95),
                               wait             = 150,
                               steps            = 50,
                               affirm           = c(0,50),
                               lag              = 0,
                               N                = c(650,800,1000),
                               printProgress    = FALSE,
                               outData          = FALSE))
```

```{r, cache=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
summary(PRISMc, N=800, affirm = 0)
```

Having established Type I error control, we can further evaluate
operating characteristics under a range of plausible outcomes.

This next step was run previously but is shown here again as it is when the step 
would more naturally take place.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Shift effects
# On the log-odds scale, shift from -0.1 to 0.7 and exponentiate back to odds ratio scale
se <- round(exp(seq(-0.1, .7, by = .1)),2)
system.time(PRISMse <- fixedDesignEffects(PRISM, shift = se))
```

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=10, fig.width=7}
par(mfrow=c(3,2))
plot(PRISMse, stat = "rejH0", N = 800, affirm = 0)
plot(PRISMse, stat = "stopNotROPE", N = 800, affirm = 0)
plot(PRISMse, stat = "stopNotROME", N = 800, affirm = 0)
plot(PRISMse, stat = "stopInconclusive", N = 800, affirm = 0)
plot(PRISMse, stat = "bias", N = 800, affirm = 0)
plot(PRISMse, stat = "cover", N = 800, affirm = 0)
```

## Example interpretations following SeqSGPV monitoring of PRISM:

1.  The estimated odds ratio was 2.47 (95% confidence interval: 1.11,
    5.46) which is evidence that the treatment effect is at least
    trivially better than the null hypothesis (p$_{ROWPE}$ = 0) and the
    evidence for being scientifically meaningful (p$_{ROME}$ = 0.91).

2.  The estimated odds ratio was 0.88 (95% confidence interval: 0.52,
    1.49) which is evidence that the treatment effect is not
    scientifically meaningful (p$_{ROME}$ = 0) and the evidence for
    being practically equivalent or worse than the point null is
    p$_{ROWPE}$=0.60.

3.  The estimated odds ratio was 1.14 (95% credible interval: 0.83,
    1.57) at the maximum sample size, which is inconclusive evidence to
    rule out practically null effects (p$_{ROWPE}$ = 0.36) and
    scientifically meaningful effects (p$_{ROME}$=0.09). There is
    more evidence that the effect is scientifically meaningful rather
    than practically null.
